## Welcome
This Repository contains the full code of RISC-V CPU CORE developed during the course and also includes resources provided in Linux Foundation by Steve Hoover

## Solution Code
The Solution code for Building RISC-V CPU CORE on Makerchip IDE using TL-verilog was developed by Ashrit V during the course timeline.You can find the Solution <a>here<a/> and it is encouraged to take up the course and write the code on your own for understanding the working of each stage during CPU build.
